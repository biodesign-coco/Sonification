// Wire Slave Receiver and Sender when request from Master

// Demonstrates use of the Wire library
// Receives data as an I2C/TWI slave device
// Refer to the "Wire Master Writer" example for use with this

// Created 29 March 2006


#include <SD.h> //supply the correct protocols for reading and parsing the micro SD card ->obligatory for Musicplayer
#include <SPI.h> //serial peripheral interface, what sends data between your Arduino and the Mmusic shield using the pins ->obligatory for Musicplayer
#include <arduino.h> // Arduino set of instructions -> obligatory to use arduino
#include <MusicPlayer.h> // to code up in keywords rather than having to scratch code for the SPI, SD and the VS1053B chip
